2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users): 
    sudo usermod -aG engineers sam
    sudo usermod -aG engineers joe
    sudo usermod -aG engineers amy
    sudo usermod -aG engineers sara

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: mkdir engineers

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: sudo chown -R sam:engineers /home/engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: sudo apt-get install -y lynis

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: man lynis

3. Command to run an audit: sudo lynis audit system 

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.
